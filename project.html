            <hr>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Overview</h2>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">My project will be the development of a series of games, culminating with an advanced Unreal Engine 4
                project that will act as a showcase for game development skills in my portfolio, and help advance me
                towards my ideal job.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">I will start by creating a small game with basic gameplay elements such as graphics, sound, character
                movement, and a gameplay loop. After each game is complete, I will either create a new game
                incorporating features from the previous game and expanding them or update my previous game by
                revising old features and adding new features. I will supplement my background knowledge by
                developing my gameplay logic with C# and using version control systems.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">Obstacles will include learning to work with the required tools and debugging my projects when things
                donâ€™t work correctly.</p>
            
            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Motivation</h2>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">My motivation is to improve my technical skills by continuously expanding on my knowledge and
                applying it in a practical way. By exploring how to develop and utilize individual concepts such as
                graphics, audio, user interfaces, artificial intelligence, player interaction, and finer gameplay elements, I
                will learn how I can apply them to a larger project and deliver a fully featured gameplay experience.
                This will be a strong display of skills for my portfolio and demonstrate progress towards my ideal job, as
                well as developing my ability to manage a project.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Description</h2>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">This project will deliver a series of smaller technical demonstrations for various gameplay systems in
                Unreal Engine 4, and a major Unreal Engine 4 project that demonstrates how I have developed my skills,
                and how I can combine them to deliver a product. Each of the smaller demonstrations will have a small
                gameplay loop and introduce, or revise, a different concept I have developed.
                For example, I may begin with a basic gameplay loop, and add features to demonstrate how I can
                include different user interface elements. I could then refine this demonstration by creating an
                inventory system or incorporating other concepts such as sound into the user interface.
                I will also incorporate other systems I have developed into later demonstrations to increase complexity
                and show how different gameplay elements can be integrated with each other.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">The major Unreal Engine 4 project will include most of the concepts delivered by earlier technical
                demonstrations, further improving on them to deliver a more in-depth gameplay experience. It will be
                built using placeholder art assets but include a significant gameplay loop with many options for player
                interactions, and many different gameplay systems co-existing to create a full experience.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">During the development of my technical demonstrations and final project I will maintain status updates
                at a webpage on a regular basis documenting my current work, explaining how some of my code and
                gameplay systems are implemented, and discussing the thought processes behind my decisions.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">Project files will be maintained through a public repository so that others may follow along with my
                work and learn new game development techniques themselves.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">The final product will include a webpage displaying my technical demonstrations accompanied by
                technical overviews, and a webpage displaying my final project with a more in-depth technical overview,
                and a discussion about gameplay mechanics.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Tools and Technologies</h2>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">This project will rely on the Unreal Engine 4 (<i>Epic Games</i>, 2021) and UnrealCLR (<i>Stanislav Denisov</i>, 2021)
                technologies to provide a game engine that supports the programming of gameplay logic in C#.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">GitHub (<i>GitHub</i>, 2021) will be used for version control on the Unreal Engine 4 projects, and the
                accompanying webpages.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">This project will require a computer capable of running the Unreal Engine 4 Editor, and an integrated
                development environment that supports C# and Git.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Skills Required</h2>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">Hardware requirements for the development of this project will increase with project complexity, so a
                powerful computer is ideal.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">This project will require a moderate amount of programming skill, familiarity with a C# development
                environment, a basic understanding of Git, and experience with the Unreal Engine 4 Editor.
                Programming skills will be relevant when writing gameplay logic with C#. Git will be relevant when
                updating the project and webpage repositories. Experience with the Unreal Engine 4 Editor is a
                requirement as many gameplay systems are tied to editor tools.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:center;">Outcome</h2>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">If this project is successful, I will have a comprehensive portfolio of my work that supports the needs of
                my ideal job and makes me more attractive to potential employers and collaborators. It will
                demonstrate my experience with Unreal Engine 4, familiarity with C# development, and ability to
                manage projects with version control systems like Git.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">I will also have the basis to form a team and work to deliver a polished experience, producing a full
                independent game with custom art assets and a larger scope.</p>
