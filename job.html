            <p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;"><b>Figure 1:</b> <i>Game Play Programmer Job Listing</i> by Milestone Information Technology, June 2021</p>
            <img src="joblisting.jpg", alt="Game Play Programmer job listing" style="width:50%;height:auto;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
            <p style="font-size:22px;">I have chosen to focus on the role of Game Play Programmer as an ideal job. For this job listing, I would
                be tasked with development and maintenance of code related to gameplay, backend, and user
                experience. This position appeals to me because I have an interest in programming, keen attention to
                detail, and I like to work on games as well as play them.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">Although this position does not ask for formal qualification, I would not expect to be hired without
                strong C# programming skills and an Unreal Engine 4 project as a part of my portfolio. </p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">To meet these requirements, I would need to become more confident in using developer operations and
                source control tools, expand on my programming knowledge and become more fluent in C#, and
                become more adept at using Unreal Engine 4 to develop gameplay systems.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">As I already have some basic experience using Unreal Engine tools, I can solidify these skills by creating a
                series of small games, with each game increasing the level of complexity and refining on previous
                concepts.</p>
