            <p style="font-size:22px;">The Meyers-Briggs personality test conducted by <i>16Personalities</i> (2021) concluded that my personality
                type is Turbulent Advocate, and that my core values are idealism and integrity.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">The VARK Questionnaire conducted by <i>VARK Learn</i> (2021) concluded that my learning style is
                multimodal and can adapt to suit my needs, but that reading, and writing are my key strengths.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">The Big Five personality test conducted by the <i>Open-Source Psychometrics Project</i> (2021) concluded that
                my two strongest personality traits are agreeableness and being open to new ideas or experiences.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">Although I can’t make claims towards the accuracy of these results, I feel they represent my personality
                well and provide a good summary of my personal strengths. I learn best with written material, and
                although I am open to lots of new ideas and experiences, my ideals are strong and difficult to change.</p>
            <p style="font-size:22px;">In a team environment, my strengths will determine who I can work with most efficiently. If I feel a team
                lacks integrity or doesn’t share similar ideals to mine, I might struggle to fit in with the group.
                It may also impact the quality of my work if I don’t have written material to learn with.</p>   
            <p style="font-size:22px;">To form a team, I would need to make sure that each team member’s ideals roughly align with mine,
                and that we are all open to discussing new ideas. Otherwise, if I have ideological concerns, or ideas I
                believe to be important that can’t be communicated effectively, I could become frustrated and less cooperative.</p>
